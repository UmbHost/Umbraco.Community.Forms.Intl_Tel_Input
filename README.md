## Getting started

This package is supported on Umbraco 15+ and Umbraco Forms 15+.

### Installation

Umbraco.Community.Forms.Intl-Tel-Input is available from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Community.Forms.Intl_Tel_Input) or as a manual download directly from GitHub.

    dotnet add package Umbraco.Community.Forms.Intl-Tel-Input

## Getting Started

If you wish to auto detect the users country, you will need to get an API key from [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/).

You will need to add the following setting to your `appsettings.json`

      "IntlTelInput": {
        "IPinfoKey": "YOUR API KEY"
      }

You must add the following if statement to the end of your Umbraco Forms theme `Render.cshtml` file:

```
    @if (Model.CurrentPage.JavascriptCommands.Any())
    {
        <script>
            document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
                @foreach (var javascriptCommand in Model.CurrentPage.JavascriptCommands)
                {
                    @Html.Raw(javascriptCommand)
                }
            });
        </script>
    }
```

It should be placed directly after the following lines:

```
    @* Form Scripts *@
    @if (Model.RenderScriptFiles)
    {
        @* Render the scripts.cshtml file to included standard conditionals and validation logic *@
        await Html.RenderPartialAsync(formScriptView);
    }
```

The following settings are available on the field type, and are set on each form within the Umbraco Forms Backoffice.

* Validation message
* Placeholder
* Initial country
* Enable / Disable auto country detection
* Restrict drop down list options to certain countries
* Specify which countries should be boosted and appear at the top of the drop down list
